whenever someone does .wish .work,
members will be reminded to use reminder bot

they can subscribe to the bot using .subscribe then use it
they can unsubscribe using .unsubscribe

they can set reminders with .r wish, and .r work


database:

there will be command prefix
there will be amount to cut
reminder channel
subscribers
action channel
action message

all done time to:
speed up prefix thingy
make sure people cant subscribe again n again (done)

just need to add timer where it will send advertisement of this bot, and then done!
